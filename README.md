## Overview
Welcome! This project is all about diving deep into Hotstar's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal? To uncover meaningful insights that help answer key business questions and provide a better understanding of the platform’s content.

## What This Project is About
Streaming platforms like Hotstar host a massive library of movies and TV shows, but what kind of content performs best? What trends can we identify? Are there patterns in genres, release years, or regional content? These are just some of the questions we aim to answer.

Using SQL, we’ll analyze the dataset, extract valuable insights, and present findings that could help business decisions—whether it's about improving recommendations, expanding content, or understanding viewer preferences.

## The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset
